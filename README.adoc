This is the code repository for the Functional Java website which is available at http://www.functionaljava.org/.

The Functional Java code repository is at https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava.

== Lifecycle

The process for changing or enhancing the site is:

* edit the source code in the `gradle` branch
* clean the build directory, run `gradlew clean`
* generate the website, run `gradlew bake`, the generated files are in `build/jbake`
* view the changes on a local server, run `gradlew appRun`.  In a browser, go to `http://localhost:8820/`.  ATM, the logo at the top of the index.html page doesn't display.
* publish the generated pages to Github.  Copy the files from the `gradle` branch's directory `build/jbake` to the `master` branch's root directory.  Commit the files and push.  You should see the changes within a few minutes at `http://www.functionaljava.org/`.

The website uses Gradle 4.10.2, JBake 2.3.0 and the Gradle plugin `org.jbake.site` version 1.2.0.  The project uses the Gradle wrapper, so it can be run if Gradle is not installed using the `./gradlew` command.  Useful gradle targets are:

* clean - Removes all generated files
* bake - create the website locally
* appRun - run the server to preview the website (accessible from http://localhost:8820)
* publish - commit the website to the master branch to make available publicly accessible on the website.  As of Feb 2022, publishing to Github didn't work.
